            <h2>Something about me...</h2>
            <p>I am a Moldovan who moved to the US with my family four years ago after winning the Green Card lottery. <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I was raised in a post-Soviet country, I speak both Romanian and Russian fluently. I also speak English with ease and have good understanding of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. During my time in high school and college, I also learned German and French, but I never had the chance to put those skills to use. <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; I hold a computer science bachelor's degree from my native country as well as a database management certificate from California. The only thing I don't have yet is programming experience. <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; In terms of my personal life, I am a happy wife and a mother of two children.</p>
