<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>I am fairly new to this entire tech world and thus far, I am loving it! 
    I believe that through tech we could really change the world and connect communities. 
    I've always believed communication is key. Effective communication is extremely important
    in everything we do such as: interviews, communications in our workplace and relationships, 
    and to interact with everyone around us, even strangers. I believe teach is now taking
    communication to another level. Connecting individuals from different backgrounds, cultures
    and creating this new world where we can come together and fight for what we believe is right.
    This is just one of the main reasons I decided to break into tech. So, welcome to my journey.
    This entire web design is my first project but WILL NOT be my last!</p>
