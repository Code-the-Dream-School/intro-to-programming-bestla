About:
My name is Eliane and I am a developer from Ohio!  I love what I do and I want 
to make a difference in the world!  I have an adorable cat named Snowball.

Experience:
I have worked in healthcare for the past 10 years in various roles.  My most 
recent job was a systems analyst.  My plan is to get a fancy Web Developer position
that allows me to have a great impact while perfecting my skills.
