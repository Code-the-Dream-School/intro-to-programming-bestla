Larasati Sodjati

About
I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia, and thought I would spend my whole life there and retire in Bali. 
Seasons in my life have since then changed, and fate brought me here to start my new journey in the USA.
I'm currently a Research Assistant at Cal State University Auxiliary Service Corporation, Fullerton. 
I manage data entry and connect with new people every day, which is not new for me. 
I have experience in administration, business development, and working with people from different backgrounds and nationalities in my 6+ year career. 
I love traveling and learning new languages. I speak beginner-level Korean and had the opportunity to practice my language skills during my internship in Korea in 2015. 
I've also had the opportunity to travel to Thailand and China for job training and learn more about the culture as well. I truly enjoy immersive cultural and language learning,
and cherish these opportunities as some of the best experiences that Iâ€™ve ever had in my life.
