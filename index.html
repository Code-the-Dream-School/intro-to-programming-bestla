<h1>About</h1>
<pr>In the recent years I became interested on programming, a dear friend of mine recommended me Code The Dream;
there's nothing that I enjoy more than coding.</pr>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<pr>This is my second time going through the Intro Class, because I felt I could learn more about JavaScript, since it has been my weakest skill. I enjoy CSS and HTML.
