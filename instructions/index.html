About
Hello, my name is Kimberly Bayardo. I am faily new to this entire tech world and thus far 
I am loving it. I believe that through tech we could really change the world and connect
communities. I've always believed communication is key. We use it conduct interviews
express how we feel and at times we express physical emotions. I believe teach is now taking
communication to another level. Connecting individuals from different backgrounds, cultures
and creating this new world where we can come together and fight for what we believe is right.
This is just one of the main reasons i decided to break into tech. So welcome and check out my 
first project.
